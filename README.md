# Project SCI AID by the Utah NeuroRobotics Lab
## Voice-Controlled 2 DOF Robot Arm for Spinal Cord Injury Patients

## Overview
This project aims to provide a solution for patients with spinal cord injuries by developing a **Voice-Controlled 2 Degree of Freedom (2 DOF) Robot Arm**. The primary goal is to empower users to control the position and actions of the robot arm through voice commands, offering them greater independence in performing various daily tasks.

## Features
- 2 DOF: Enables shoulder and elbow motion for reaching and grasping objects.
- Voice Control: Simple commands like "open" or "close" allow for effortless gripper manipulation.
- PI + Torque Feedback Control Loop: Ensures precise arm positioning and compliant control.
- Hall-effect sensor feedback: Provides accurate joint angle and gripper state monitoring.
